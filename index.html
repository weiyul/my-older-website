							<h1>I promise myself</h1>
							<p>To be so strong that nothing can disturb my peace of mind.</p>
							<p>To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person I meet.</p>
							<p>To make all my friends feel that there is something worthwhile in them.</p>
							<p>To look at the sunny side of everything and make my optimism come true.</p>
							<p>To think only of the best, to work only for the best , and to expect only the best.</p>
							<p>To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as I am about my own.</p>
							<p>To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future.</p>
							<p>To wear a cheerful expression at all times and give a smile to every living creature I meet.</p>
							<p>To give so much time to improving myself that I have no time to criticize others.</p>
							<p>To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear, and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.</p>
							<p>To think well of myself and to proclaim this fact to the world, not in loud words, but in great deeds.</p>
							<p>To live in the faith that the whole world is on my side, so long as I am true to the best that is in me.</p>
